Welcome to Java and OpenGL Parallel algorithms application!

In this application, you can create, edit and export your projects, generated shaders and scripts
You can create, load and save projects via bar.
You can also use different functions and create your own.
Application has a file with different templates that are used to describe blocks and generate their code.
This application allows to model, design, test and prototype simple shaders.
This application can manage 2 types of shaders: fragment shaders and compute shader.
In order to use compute shaders, your system should have OpenGL 4.3 implemented in graphics card driver
Once shader is created, you can run it in simulation environment.
This environment is controlled by simple scripts. You can use the following commands:
1)  new window
2)	new texture
3)  new buffer
4)  new shader
5)  new program
6)  load texture
7)  generate shader
8)  set program
9)  set var
10)  set bool
11) set int
12) set uint
13) set float
14) set label
15) go to
16) bind image
17) bind buffer
18) draw
19) check
20) compute
21) close window
22) delete texture
23) delete buffer
24) delete shader
25) delete program
26) exit
